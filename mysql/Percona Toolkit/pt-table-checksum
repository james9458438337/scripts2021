4) pt-table-checksum: Performs an online replication consistency check by executing checksum queries on the master, which produces different results on replicas that are inconsistent with the master.

Example :

checksum1Shell
[root@Tst1Master ~]# ./pt-table-checksum -dD
            TS ERRORS  DIFFS     ROWS  CHUNKS SKIPPED    TIME TABLE
03-03T02:34:44      0      1        2       1       0   0.011 d.t

            TS ERRORS  DIFFS     ROWS  CHUNKS SKIPPED    TIME TABLE

Note: It  is important to run the pt-table-checksum tool regardless of whether or not youâ€™ve ever skipped an event with pt-slave-restart to make sure we are having the identical data on the slave side.
