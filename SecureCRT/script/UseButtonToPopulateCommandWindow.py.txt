# UseButtonToPopulateCommandWindow.py
#   Last Modified: 05 Nov, 2016
#     - Initial version
#
# Description:
#   Shows one way to populate the command window with text
#
# Usage:
#   Map a button to run this script. In the "Arguments" field of the Map
#   Button window, specify the text you want to place into the command
#   window.
#     - If there are no script args, the contents of the clibpoard are
#       placed into the Command Window.
#     - Multiple Arguments are placed into the clipboard separated with \r,
#       so if you want to send multiple commands...
#          term len 0
#          show ip flow top-talkers
#          show ip nat nvi translations
#       ...then you would need to specify args to this script as a quoted
#       string, with each command separated with \f, as in:
#          "term len 0\rshow ip flow top-talkers\rshow ip nat nvi translations"
