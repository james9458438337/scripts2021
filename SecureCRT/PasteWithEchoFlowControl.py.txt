# Description:
#   Demonstrates how to send a block of lines from the clipboard and
#   wait for those lines to be echoed back by the remote host before the next
#   block of lines is sent. This is one approach to prevent overwhelming a
#   remote host that cannot accept data as fast as SecureCRT normally sends it
#   by making sure the remote machine has received each block of lines before
#   moving on with the next block.
