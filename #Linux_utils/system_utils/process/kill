#How to Kill Linux Process Using Kill, Pkill and Killall

Kill command sends a signal, a specified signal to a currently running process. The kill command can be executed in a number of ways, directly or from a shell script.

kill [signal or option] PID(s)

SIGTERM is the default and safest way to kill a process. 
SIGHUP is a less secure way of killing a process than SIGTERM. 
SIGKILL is the most unsafe way among the above three, to kill a process that terminates a process without saving.

How about Customising the above output using syntax as ‘pidof process‘.
pidof mysqld
pgrep sshd

kill -9 3139
kill -SIGTERM 3139
